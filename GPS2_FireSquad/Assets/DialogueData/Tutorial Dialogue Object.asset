    in three different roles to help save the lives of many civilians!\r\nLet\u2019s
    start!\r\n"
  - 'Here is the Extinguisher. He specialises in taking care of fires throughout
    the building.

    to start extinguishing the fire! The Extinguisher is immune to the fire and flames
    found throughout the building."
  - The flames have a bar to indicate how close to being extinguished they are. Hold
    down the interaction button until the bar disappears! Now extinguish all of the
    fire.

    swap button on the top left of your screen!"
  - 'This is the Medic. He specialises in safely retrieving the civilians trapped
    in the building. He also helps his teammates who may have slipped in the line
    of duty.

'
  - 'These are the civilians that you need to rescue from the fire and debris.

    Walk
    over to one of them and press the interaction button to pick one up!

'
  - Great! Now, bring the two civilians over to the rescue zone on the right, one
    by one.
  - "Good job! Now let\u2019s move on to the final member of your squad!"
  - 'This is the Demolisher. He specializes in breaking down doors and walls that
    are in the way of rescuing civilians and putting out fires. He is also immune
    to traps that may be found in his surroundings.

    Use the control pad to
    walk over to that wall.

'
  - This is a breakable wall. Press the interact button to begin breaking it down.
  - "And there you go! You\u2019re all set to start your job in the Fire Squad! You\u2019ll
    be going against the clock to complete all your tasks.\r\nGood luck out there!
    \r\n"
